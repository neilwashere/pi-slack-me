Each message is LEASED, not completed: it is hidden from other reads for lease_seconds, then handed out again unless slack_ack_inbox is called with its key. Work the batch, then ack it, so a crash mid-task replays the message instead of losing it.

Returns how many of the supplied keys were still retained.`;

export const CATCH_UP_DESCRIPTION = `Reconcile messages Slack sent while the Socket Mode listener was offline. Socket Mode never replays missed events, so this performs bounded Web API reads: workspace mentions (requires search:read), accessible DMs and group DMs, known or watched conversations, and tracked threads. Results enter the same durable inbox and deduplicate against live events. Run this when an autonomous agent starts before reading its inbox. The result reports added, scanned, truncated, and errors; truncated or errors means the delta was not proven complete and should be reported rather than silently treated as clean.`;
